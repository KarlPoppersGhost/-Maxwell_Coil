# -Maxwell_Coil
A simulation of the magnetic field generated by a Maxwell Coil using MatLab. The relative position, size, and amount of current in each of the three short-solenoids produces a uniform (in magnitude and direction) magnetic field at the center of the arrangement. In an fMRI scan this field produces magnetic dipole moments (in hydrogen atoms) which accumulate in our bodies and whose decay produces the signal required to generate the image.
