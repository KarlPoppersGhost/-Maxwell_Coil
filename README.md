# -Maxwell_Coil
A simulation of the magnetic field generated by a 'Maxwell Coil' with MatLab. The relative position, size, and amount of current in the three short-solenoids produces a very uniform magnetic field in the center of the arrangement. 

During an fMRI scan a uniform magnetic field is needed to generate magnetic dipole moments in Hydrogen. These moments accumulate and process like a gyroscope to produce the signal required to generate medical images.

Very cool!
